	// Place your snippets for robot here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Log to console": {
		"prefix": ["log", "print"],
		"body": "Log To Console  ${$1}",			
		"description": "Log output to console"
	},
	"For loop":{
		"prefix": "for",
		"body": [
			"FOR  ${$1}  IN  @{$2}",
			"\t${$1}",
			"END"
		],
		"description": "For loop"
	},
	"Create Variable":{
		"prefix": ["variable", "Variable"],
		"body": "${$1}=  $0",
		"description": "Create Robot variable"
	}
